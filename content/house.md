## A Perfect Location in the Heart of Boston

515 Beacon Street places us in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city. Here’s what makes it special:

- **Quick access to MIT** – Just across the Harvard Bridge, it’s a scenic 15-minute walk or short bike ride to campus.
- **Iconic surroundings** – We’re steps away from the Charles River Esplanade, Commonwealth Avenue, and Newbury Street’s cafes and shops.
- **Central for everyone** – Convenient for meeting with friends, alumni, and other Boston-area chapters.
- **Transit-friendly** – Easy access to the Green Line, buses, and bike lanes makes getting around the city simple.
